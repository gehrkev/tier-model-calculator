                The R value shows how efficiently you're using your time to earn money. While it can be tricky
                to understand at first, it measures the relationship between your total income (both passive
                and active) and the time invested in active income. A lower R means better efficiency - like
                a golf score, the lower the better.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Increasing passive income improves (lowers) your R score because it adds to your total income
                without requiring additional time investment. Changes in work hours and active income will
                also affect your efficiency, but in more complex ways since active income requires time investment.
